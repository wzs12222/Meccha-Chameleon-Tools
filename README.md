## Package Structure

```
meccha_chameleon_tools/
  __init__.py        Entry point
  __main__.py        Module runner
  config.py          Configuration + JSON save/load
  core.py            Memory reading, ESP logic, role detection
  translations.py    Multi-language EN/DE/FR/ES/CN/JP/KR
  ui.py              Qt5 overlay + menu GUI
  camouflage.py      Camouflage bridge controller (DEV)
  runtime-bridge.dll Bridge DLL for camouflage (DEV)
  runtime-injector.exe DLL injector for camouflage (DEV)
```

---

## Architecture

```
PatternScanner → GUObjectArray, FNamePool
UObjectArray   → find_class, iter_objects
OffsetResolver → dynamic property walking
GameReader     → world, camera, players, role detection
Overlay        → QPainter rendering loop @ 60 fps
Menu           → PyQt5 settings window (6 tabs)
Bridge DLL     → TCP command server for teleport, player_mod
Camouflage     → TCP bridge client + injector (in development)
```

### Memory Access

1. **Pattern scanning** locates GUObjectArray and FNamePool via signature matching.
2. **Object walking** enumerates all UObjects to resolve engine class addresses.
3. **Dynamic offset resolution** walks UStruct::ChildProperties → FField::Next at runtime.
4. **ESP** projects player positions through the camera view matrix.
5. **Radar** projects positions relative to local player onto a 2D minimap.
6. **Aimbot** reads/writes ControlRotation with configurable smoothing.
7. **Camouflage** injects a bridge DLL into the game process and sends paint commands via TCP on port 50262 *(in development)*.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Game attach failed | Verify PenguinHotel-Win64-Shipping.exe is running |
| ESP shows nothing | Load into a match |
| Fewer players detected | Disable Team Filter |
| Snap lines not visible | Off-screen players draw lines to screen edge |
| Aimbot not firing | Re-record the aim key |
| Radar not showing | Enable Radar Enabled in the RADAR tab |
| Player Mod not working | Must be game host |
